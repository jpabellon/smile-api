##  About Smile
Hello and welcome to Smile! 

We provide user-authorized access to valuable employment and income data from HR, payroll, commerce, and marketplace platforms through a single API! If you work at a bank, fintech, recruitment agency, or any other service provider, you can leverage employment and income data to increase adoption and conversion for your application, reduce cost in performing processes within your organization such as doing employment and identity verification checks, and reduce risk such as the risk of defaults especially if you are a lender. 

Access to the data is provided by the employees themselves, which is part of the API we provide. We offer a mechanism by which your users can give their consent to have this personal data collected and transmitted to you or any party they trust on their behalf. This is all done in a simple, secure and seamless way.

##  Our API
The Smile API is built on RESTful principles. All request and response payloads are encoded in JSON format. For security purposes, all requests must be sent through HTTPS. To get access to the API, you will need to contact us at access@getsmileapi.com. Soon we will also provide a Developer portal so that you can get access to the API yourselves just by registering.

## Available data
To be able to retrieve data and use it in your application, you will need to embed our Wink widget into your application. From the widget your users will then need to select the provider from which their employment data will come from.  After this, they will need to enter their credentials and consent for Smile to retrieve that data on their behalf. After giving permission, this data will then be retrieved, aggregated, normalized into a standard schema and sent to you in a developer-friendly JSON format. 

The available data includes:

| Action   | Type    | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Identity | Profile | Get vetted identity information from current and previous employers such as name, contact information, residential address, and others.|
| Jobs (coming soon)     | Profile | Get previous employment history, including job title, status, tenure, employer names, employer contact information, and others.|
| Income (coming soon)  | Profile | Get previous earnings information such as gross pay and net pay, as well as other components that make up income.|  
| Documents (coming soon)  | Profile | Get documentary information such as their driver's license, national identity card ID, and others.|

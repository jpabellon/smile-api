# Problems we are Solving

1. For individuals, we want to make access and sharing of personal, employment, and financial data easy, seamless, and secure, so that they can:
    - Get access to financial services such as a savings account, payroll account, credit card, loans, insurance
    - Get access to other services such as utilities, postpaid telco accounts, which typically go through a KYC process, and verification of income
    - Apply for a job easily, which requires employment history and background checks
2. For businesses, we want to lower the cost of verification and compliance, by providing:
    - Readily accessible data (either via API and/or self-service portal) on an individual's employment history, income, and identity
    - Improve user experience/user conversion for digital services, by allowing users to auto populate application forms
    - Ready reports for reporting, analysis, compliance, and audits
    - Financial flexibility, through usage-based billing‚Äîpay only for the API calls made, APIs consumed
3. For developers, we want to make the integration of our APIs fast, easy and simple, so that
    - They can easily get started
    - They can work with the existing knowledge, tools they know, since we will provide them standard interfaces/protocols (eg REST/GraphQL via HTTPS, using XML/JSON data formats)
    - They are incentivized to just use our service, instead of building the integrations for their applications themselves

# Example Use Cases and Benefits

1. Work and income verification (for KYC)
2. Auto-populate applications (for smoother onboarding, improved conversion)
3. Direct deposit switching (for payroll, employee onboarding)

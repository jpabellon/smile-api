## Query Parameters

API endpoints which return a collection of objects can be filtered or limited based on different query parameters:

|Parameter |Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|
|size |The number of objects you want returned in a collection |
|cursor |Uses the filter values of the previous page to determine the next set of items |

Some resources however have unique query parameters associated with them. Check out the documentation in each of the endpoints to find out more.

## Rate Limits

Smile limits the amount of API calls that can be made to each endpoint to ensure the stability and availability of the platform. At the moment we only allow clients a maximum of up to 50 requests per endpoint per second. Clients which make too many requests in succession will be given an error with HTTP Status Code 429 or too many requests. To request a higher limit, please contact access@getsmileapi.com.
